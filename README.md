## Travel-service-landing-page Design Test
This repository contains my solution to the "Travel-service-landing-page Design Test" using React.

## Design Details
I have designed the settings page for both desktop and mobile views using Tailwind CSS and React. The design is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
